# Project overview

This is the third and last project from the **JavaScript Basics** section of the [Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics).

The aim is to create a calculator performing basic math operations on pairs of numbers using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

A live preview of the project is available [here](https://sabrunel.github.io/calculator/).

# What I learned

This project was all about practising Javascript functions, including arrow functions.

It was also a neat occasion to try out CSS grid for the first time.

# What's next

This calculator could use some keyboard support. 
Also, the `%` button is currently a placeholder.
